// The following is extra credit (10pts):
//  • Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions you write.
//  • Note Mocha/Chai: The Mocha/Chai framework recently removed Common JS functionality. You will need to use these specific versions:
//      o chai: "^4.3.10”
//      o mocha: "^10.2.0”
//      o You can use this boiler plate project for your unit testing: Mocha/Chai Github Repository
